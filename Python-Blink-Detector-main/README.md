Python Blink Detector
</h1>

A simple Python script I wrote that tracks and detects eyes, detects when you blink using facial landmarks, and triggers a stroke of your desired key.

You can edit which key gets pressed in the script when blinked (e.g. ESC, ALT, SPACE, etc.).

Code is well commented and documented.

# Requirements
In order to run, install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/, then run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in directory with this repository.

You will need a webcam, since this project relys on you blinking in order to trigger a keystroke.
