# VISION-AI

In this project, we developed a tool named VISION-AI, based on artificial intelligence to prevent identity theft. 
Here we tried to develop the student portal for secure log-in to the discussion panel. Before checking the student, he/she should enter their details in the student portal for registration. After registration,  the details entered by the students will be saved into a file. Also, the image captured through the webcam will be saved into a directory. The only registered students will be allowed to entering the discussion panel.
